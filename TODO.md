#TODO#
[ ] -pe is great but it's a weird name and it doesn't work. English dictionaries are not being created at all from what I can tell.
[ ] Add option to rename wordlists to name of the language.
    [ ] If there are duplicates just add a 2 or 3 etc. to the end.
    [ ] Add the total number of words (lines) into the name as another option
[ ] Improve StarDict processing - decompress .dict.dz and parse HTML definitions
